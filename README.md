# Grant Me a Pure Heart

Grant me a pure heart o' Sugmad
From which their compassion may touch another
Instil in me the tenderness that quietens a torn heart
and also the strength to uplift in another thy love

Grant me a resolution o' Sugmad
that I may may move onward, towards their purpose
and always act in their name.
